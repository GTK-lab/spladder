Installation and Dependencies
-----------------------------

The python version of SplAdder does not require any installation process. It can
be used as is, given that the following dependencies are fulfilled:

* pysam
* h5py
* scipy

These are standard packages and the authors suggest to use a python package
manager such as anaconda.

To start SplAdder and see a list of all available options, use:

```
