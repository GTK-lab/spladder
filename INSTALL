Installation and Dependencies
-----------------------------

You can install SplAdder into your local PATH using
```
make install
```

For SplAdder to run, all dependencies listed in requirements.txt must be available 
on your system.

We recommend using a python package manager such as anaconda to organize dependencies.

To start SplAdder and see a list of all available options, you can simply type:
```
spladder
```

Example Data
------------

To check if your SplAdder installation is working and all dependencies are met,
we provide some test cases that compute the results on example data.

Please invoke ```make test``` after installation completed to start the test procedure.
